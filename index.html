        <div class="subheading mb-5">TFDP: Film Making</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ryan Busse and I am an aspiring filmmaker with an emphasis on production design. I am currently a fourth year TFDP major at UC Riverside with a concentration in Film Making. During high school, I participated in my school’s media arts program where we were introduced to the many aspects of media such as digital graphics and video production. The course opened my eyes to the world of entertainment and the process that goes into producing film. When participating in group film projects, I usually contribute as the property master, providing and creating the many props that were used, a role that I specialize in to this day. Additionally, the course introduced us to multiple softwares that allowed us to become familiar with digital illustration, photoshop, and video editing.<br><br>

        After high school, I enrolled in two years of junior college where I declared my major in filmmaking. There, I partook in film related classes that improved my skills with video editing and screenwriting. During that time I was also introduced to the field of sound recording where I was able to work with several pieces of sound equipment. When I transferred to UC Riverside, I continued my film studies as a TFDP major with a concentration in Film Making.<br><br>

        To expand my knowledge and experience in filmmaking, I joined UC Riverside’s film club, R’Shorts. There I earned on-set experience and learned what it was like to work for a short film production. I enrolled in positions such as a head and crew member for set design as well as a crew member for costume and makeup. The club also provided networking, allowing me to meet and share contact information with others involved in the entertainment industry. This introduced opportunities to work on projects outside the boundaries of the University. One of which was a short film in which I fabricated prop weapons and fake substances.
        
        In addition to filmmaking, I have participated in the production of multiple theatrical performances hosted by UC Riverside. The areas in theater I worked in involved painting set pieces as well as fabricating props.
        
        During a summer, I participated in a ten week internship for an educational animation project called The Mista Pat Project. My role for the project was to create digital illustrations of the backgrounds as well as character models that were animated. In addition to this, I created the storyboard for one of the episodes.
